# Game 450 Project

There are 3 areas of work on the project due on the final exam day for this course i.e. at 11:59 PM on 5/3/2023. The three areas of work are:

1. (5 pts) Fixing the game by integrating the three components:
   a. Incorporate the GA system to make cities spread out realistically.
   b. Implement cost of travel based on the elevation of the terrain.
   c. Restrict movement between cities without a route.
   c. Fix the gameplay by making the player win or lose the game based on having no money and/or losing the battle. (Synthesis - remaining 5pts of synthesis come from Lab 11: Project Handoff (Task 1) lab )

2. (10 pts) Incorporate one additional AI technique like journalling using text generation models text-to-image generation, speech synthesis, etc. This can be any AI technique that you have learned in class or not. The quality of output is not graded. Only the use and integration are considered for the grade. (Identifying The Right Tool)

3. (10 pts) A report clearly demonstrating all of the AI components of the game. The report should describe the problems that each of the AI methods solves. The description should also detail the inputs and outputs of each algorithm, along with a description of the algorithm. (Creative Problem Solving Rubric)

You are encouraged to use ChatGPT and are required to include the transcript of the conversation in your report in an Appendix section. Your report should be at most 3 pages (~1500 words) long excluding the Appendixes.

Please submit a URL to the commit that you want me to consider as the project submission.

Include a README.md file that will be your report in the root folder of your project that is has the following three sections (Total 1500 words excluding the Appendices section).

1. Abstract (250 words)
2. List of AI components in the project (just list the 3-4 AI components, no description needed)
3. Problems Solved (provide descriptions about the AI components in the format of problems that they solved)
   ...<Any other sections that you would like to create>
4. Appendix
